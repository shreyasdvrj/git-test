    "eventInfo": "There are plenty of reasons to swim! Here's a list that should get you motivated. There's no ground impact when you swim, and so you protect the joints from stress and strain.

Can be continued for a lifetime. Builds muscle mass. In a study of men who completed an eight-week swimming program, there was a 23.8% increase in the triceps muscle (the back of the arm). Builds cardiorespiratory fitness. Swimming improves endurance. In one study of sedentary middle-aged men and women who did swim training for 12 weeks, maximal oxygen consumption improved 10% and stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped with each beat which indicates heart strength) improved as much as 18%.",
